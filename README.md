## Telco Customer Churn Analysis:
This project focuses on *analyzing customer churn in the telecom sector* using *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Python*.  
The aim is to identify patterns, trends, and factors leading to customer churn to help the company improve retention strategies.

## Project Objectives:
